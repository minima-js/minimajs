# Minima\.js: Where Efficiency Meets Elegance

Minima.js is a cutting-edge Node.js framework meticulously designed to empower developers to construct contemporary web applications with exceptional efficiency and elegance.

**Key Features:**

- **TypeScript First:** Minima.js is built entirely in TypeScript, for TypeScript. This means you get a top-tier developer experience with excellent type safety, autocompletion, and a significant reduction in runtime errors.

- **Context over `req`/`res`:** Say goodbye to prop drilling! Minima.js uses modern `AsyncLocalStorage` to provide a global context for each request. You can access request data, headers, and more from anywhere in your code without passing `req` and `res` objects around.

- **Modern JavaScript, Today:** Minima.js is built for the future. It exclusively uses modern ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and the latest JavaScript features, without being held back by backward compatibility concerns.

- **Effortless Third-Party Integration:** Integrating third-party libraries is a breeze. Since you can access the request context from anywhere, you can easily integrate libraries that don't have direct access to the `req`/`res` objects.

- **Best-in-class Multipart and Schema Support:** Minima.js comes with robust, built-in support for multipart form data and data validation. The `@minimajs/multipart` and `@minimajs/schema` packages provide a seamless experience for handling file uploads and validating data.

- **Minimalist and Opinionated:** Minima.js follows a "one-rule of doing things" philosophy, which results in a consistent and predictable codebase. The minimalist API and lack of boilerplate allow you to focus on writing your application's logic.

- **Functional and Modular:** The framework encourages a functional and modular approach to building applications. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.

**Unparalleled Development Experience:**

- **Blazing-Fast Builds:** Bundled with Esbuild, Minima.js ensures exceptional build times, enabling rapid development iteration and deployment.
- **Straightforward Learning:** Designed with simplicity in mind, Minima.js offers an intuitive API and comprehensive documentation, making it easy for developers to get started quickly.
- **Circular Dependency Management:** Minima.js provides a clever solution to circular dependencies, promoting cleaner code architecture and smoother development workflows.

**Embrace the Future of Node.js Development**

Minima.js represents a paradigm shift in web development, offering a powerful combination of modern JavaScript, functional programming, and developer-friendly features. Empower yourself to build exceptional Node.js applications with unparalleled speed, efficiency, and elegance – regardless of project size or complexity.
