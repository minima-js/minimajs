# Introduction

Introducing the groundbreaking HTTP framework for Node.js - an innovation tailored for the modern developer seeking efficiency, elegance, and speed. This framework is designed with a forward-looking mindset, embracing the latest advancements in JavaScript while prioritizing ease of use and performance. Let's delve into its key features:

1. **Functional Approach**: Embracing the functional programming paradigm, this framework empowers developers to write clean, concise, and composable code, promoting modular design and scalability.

2. **100% TypeScript**: Built entirely in TypeScript, this framework ensures type safety throughout the development process, reducing errors and enhancing code quality, while also providing rich editor support and improved documentation.

3. **Mandatory ESM Adoption**: This framework mandates the adoption of ECMAScript Modules (ESM) over CommonJS, ensuring developers unlock the full potential of modern JavaScript features like root-level await and code splitting. By embracing ESM, developers benefit from enhanced performance, cleaner code, and improved developer experience, fostering a seamless and efficient development process.

4. **Today's Version of JavaScript**: Staying aligned with the latest JavaScript standards and best practices, this framework empowers developers with the full capabilities of modern JavaScript..

5. **Instant Context Access**: Enjoy seamless access to request data like headers or body with functions like `getRequest()` and `getBody()` anywhere within the same request context. Say goodbye to tedious req/res drilling and hello to streamlined development.

6. **Fastest Esbuild Integration**: Bundled with the lightning-fast Esbuild, this framework ensures blazingly fast build times, enabling rapid development iteration and deployment, without compromising on performance.

7. **Easy to Learn**: Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, this framework boasts an intuitive API and comprehensive documentation, making it easy for developers of all skill levels to get started and become productive quickly.

8. **No Boilerplate Needed**: Bid farewell to boilerplate code. With its minimalist approach, this framework eliminates unnecessary setup and configuration, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without any friction.

9. **Schema Validation and Multipart Support**: Ensure data integrity and security with built-in schema validation, empowering developers to validate incoming requests effortlessly. Additionally, multipart support simplifies handling of file uploads and form data, enhancing the framework's versatility.

10. **Bye-bye Circular Dependency**: Circular dependencies can be a headache in large codebases, leading to tangled and hard-to-maintain code. This framework introduces a clever solution to this common problem, providing built-in mechanisms to elegantly handle circular dependencies, ensuring cleaner code architecture and smoother development workflows. Say farewell to circular dependency headaches and focus on building robust and scalable applications with confidence.

In conclusion, this HTTP framework for Node.js represents a paradigm shift in web development, offering a powerful combination of modern JavaScript, functional programming, and developer-friendly features. Whether you're building a small-scale application or a large-scale enterprise solution, this framework equips you with the tools and flexibility needed to succeed in today's fast-paced development landscape.
