## Core Rewrite: Web-Native APIs with Universal Runtime Support

Complete rewrite of core packages from the ground up with the following improvements:

- **Web-Native APIs**: Built using standard Web APIs for better compatibility and performance
- **Platform Independent**: First-class support for both Node.js and Bun runtimes
- **Modern Architecture**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with improved type safety
- **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized for modern JavaScript engines

This is a foundational change that improves the framework's portability and future-proofing across different JavaScript runtimes.
